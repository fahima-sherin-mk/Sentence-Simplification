Academic Project: Pattern-based Automatic Syntactic Simplification (PASS)
Description:
This project focuses on Automatic Sentence Simplification (ASS) — the process of converting complex sentences into simpler ones while preserving their original meaning. Simplified sentences can improve the performance of various NLP tasks like machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and opinion mining.
Our approach, called Pattern-based Automatic Syntactic Simplification (PASS), uses grammatical patterns to identify and transform compound and complex sentences into simpler forms. The system applies rule-based transformations based on syntactic structures found in sentences.
We also evaluate the effectiveness of PASS using standard automatic metrics and compare its performance with existing simplification models.

 Key Objectives
•	Identify compound and complex sentences using grammatical patterns
•	Apply transformation rules to simplify sentence structures
•	Evaluate the simplified output and compare with existing methods
